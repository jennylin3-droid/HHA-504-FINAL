## Reflection
The part of this design I feel confident or more sure of is about the use of serverless functions to perform medication safety checks, since this directly builds back to the class HHA 504 multi-cloud serverless assignment. We learned and attempted to deploy HTTP functions on Azure and GCP. That prior work made the JSON input validation, rule-based logic, and structured response format familiar and reliable components of this project. I am also confident in the integration of cloud storage and a managed SQL database, as these elements reflect concepts introduced in Assignment 1 (Intro to Cloud) and HHA 507 Assignment 2 (SQL DB), where data persistence and structured querying were central. The use of a Flask-based frontend aligns with Assignment 2 on VMs and networking, reinforcing my understanding of how users interact with backend services. Overall, the design feels cohesive because each component builds logically on skills developed throughout the course.

The area I am least confident about involves scaling and operational complexity in a real clinical environment. While the architecture is appropriate for a prototype, a production system would require more advanced governance, monitoring, and integration with electronic health records than what was covered in earlier assignments. I considered an alternative design that placed all functionality on a single virtual machine, which would have simplified deployment and mirrored early Flask exercises, but this approach was less flexible and more costly to maintain long-term. The selected serverless and managed-service architecture better reflects modern cloud practices emphasized in the course, even if it introduces additional components. If I had an additional 4–8 weeks and unlimited credits, I would expand the system by adding configurable rule management, stronger role-based access control, and more advanced analytics similar to the inferential methods explored in the Inferential Assignment.
